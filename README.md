======================

We are in the "JavaScript Age" where more and more web applications are making heavy use of JavaScript on the client. Many of us are still writing "LAMP Age" applications where we generate pages on the server side using our favorite MVC framework. When we develop our server side code, we know we should be using good engineering practices such as modularity and unit testing.  As we continue to add more and more JavaScript, we should be applying those principles to our JavaScript code.  This session will show how to refactor your JavaScript code to incorporate these principles using only PhantomJS and your framework's build tools.  The presentation uses Grails but the concepts should apply to your favorite server side framework.
